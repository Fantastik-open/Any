# Any
### A small-scale social media website

## Introduction: What is Any?
Welcome to the GitHub Repository for Any! This website was created as the final project for [CS50x 2020](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/). I was not content leaving this website the way it is, so I created this repository to grow it. While there isn't much this website __*can*__ do, you can help me develop this website.

## How can you help me develop this website?
To develop this website, you can download the files and create a repository of your own. Upgrade the code, with comments showing what changes you have made __(format shown below)__.

```python
# The website prints "yes"
print("yes")
```
Once all your updates are done, [send an email to me](mailto:fantastikbruh@gmail.com) with `[Any Repository Update] {Your username}` as the heading, with the link to your repository in the body. No more is needed, but feel free to put in a list of the updates that you made.

### To all the people that help develop this website, thank you!
